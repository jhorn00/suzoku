# suzoku
This is a personal project to solve any (valid) sudoku board with opencv and Python. Name inspired by my aunt Suzanne (Zani).

I hope to learn a lot about Python and Computer Vision through this program. Worst case I suppose I could end up with something kind of neat :)

This readme will be updated when the project reaches a more complete state.
